My design follows a very basic brute force attack. I understand a lot of things I did 
were very slow and most definently could have been sped up. This was not very important to me though as I knew
I would perform the guesses over a relatively short list given specific set of rules.
The number one way to speed things up in my opinion would be to write a multithreaded password cracker.
After that I would probably resort to using the simpilest and fastest functions first to see if they are able to crack the password before getting to the longer more extensive word Lists.
